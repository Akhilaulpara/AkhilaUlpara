**🚀 About Me**

I’m currently exploring the vast and exciting world of AI, with a strong foundation in Machine Learning and Data Science. I love making complex data come alive through compelling visualizations — from Tableau dashboards to Python-powered insights.

My curiosity drives me to build smart, data-driven solutions — and finance happens to be another passion of mine. I recently built an Asset Price Prediction model to combine my love for numbers, trends, and intelligent forecasting.
